## Important Notes

⚠️ **This phase should be executed LAST, after all app features are complete and stable.**

Infrastructure migration introduces significant risk and should only be done when:
1. All core features are complete
2. The app is thoroughly tested
3. A proper backup strategy is in place
4. The team is prepared for potential issues
