## Image Generation Tips

1. **For Midjourney:**
   - Add `--ar 16:9` for hero images
   - Add `--ar 9:16` for mobile screenshots
   - Add `--v 6` for latest version
   - Add `--style raw` for more realistic results

2. **For DALL-E:**
   - Be very specific about dimensions
   - Mention "transparent background" explicitly
   - Use "high resolution" and "professional"

3. **For Stable Diffusion:**
   - Use negative prompts: "low quality, blurry, distorted"
   - Add "fintech, banking, professional" to positive prompts

4. **Color Consistency:**
   - Always mention purple (#5B55F6) or "vibrant purple"
   - Use "dark background compatible" for transparency
   - Mention "glassmorphism" for modern effects

5. **Post-Processing:**
   - Use tools like Remove.bg for transparent backgrounds
   - Optimize images with TinyPNG or similar
   - Convert to WebP format for better performance

## After Generating Images

1. **Optimize all images:**

   ```bash
   # Install sharp or use online tools
   # Convert to WebP format for better performance
   ```

2. **Update components:**
   - Update `HeroSection.tsx` to use `hero-cards-mockup.png`
   - Update `AppShowcaseSection.tsx` to use app screenshots
   - Update `Navbar.tsx` to use logo

3. **Add alt text:**
   - Add descriptive alt text for accessibility
   - Update components with proper image tags

## Notes

- All images should be optimized for web (compressed but high quality)
- Use WebP format when possible for better performance
- Ensure images work on dark backgrounds
- Test images on different screen sizes
- Consider generating multiple variations and choosing the best
